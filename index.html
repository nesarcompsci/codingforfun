    <h1><center>What is a Rangoli?</center></h1>
      <p align='justify'>
      Rangoli is an art form, originated in India.Where patterns are created on the floor or the ground using materials such as colored rice, dry flour, colored sand or flower petals. It is usually made during Diwali or Tihar, Onam, Pongal and other Hindu festivals in India. Designs are passed from one generation to the next, keeping both the art form and the tradition alive.
      The purpose of rangoli is to feel strength, generosity, and it is thought to bring good luck. Design depictions may also vary as they reflect traditions, folklore, and practices that are unique to each area.. Generally, this practice is showcased during occasions such as festivals, auspicious observances, marriage celebrations and other similar milestones and gatherings.

      <h1><center>What relation does Rangoli have with math?</center></h1>
      <p align='justify'>
      Rangoli is defined as the symmetry of colors. On the other hand, every point of mathematics is symmetry. The most common and important form of mathematics known as geometry is totally based on symmetry. Speaking of geometry, in rangolis we always have some sort of shape in every design. It usually is the base of many designs. That is one part, another is that all of these designs almost always have angles. Every line is a different angle and now we shall have a look at a few examples of these.
